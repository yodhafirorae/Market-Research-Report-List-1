<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fibrin Glue Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hemostat</li><li>Adhesive</li><li>Sealant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fibrin glue market is segmented into three main types: hemostats, adhesives, and sealants. Hemostats are primarily used to control bleeding during surgical procedures by promoting clot formation. Adhesives bond tissues together to facilitate healing and reduce complications in surgeries. Sealants, on the other hand, create a barrier to prevent fluid leakage, ensuring tissue integrity. Each type serves unique applications in surgical and medical settings, providing essential support in wound management, tissue repair, and surgical efficacy.</p></p>
