<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Insulin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Animal Insulin</li><li>Regular Human Insulin</li><li>Insulin Analogue</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The insulin market comprises three main types: Animal insulin, Regular human insulin, and Insulin analogues. Animal insulin, derived from animal pancreas, was historically used but has largely been replaced due to potential allergic reactions. Regular human insulin, synthesized through recombinant DNA technology, is more reliable and commonly used for glycemic control. Insulin analogues are modified forms of insulin designed for improved pharmacokinetics, offering rapid or prolonged action to better match insulin needs. Each type serves distinct patient requirements and treatment regimens.</p></p>
