<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photonic-crystal Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Index-Guiding Fibers</li><li>Photonic Bandgap (Air Guiding) Fibers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The photonic-crystal fiber market consists of two main types: index-guiding fibers and photonic bandgap (air guiding) fibers. Index-guiding fibers utilize a varying refractive index to confine light, similar to traditional optical fibers. In contrast, photonic bandgap fibers leverage structured arrangements of microscopic air holes or other materials to create a bandgap that restricts certain wavelengths, effectively guiding light through air rather than solid material. Each type offers unique benefits for applications in telecommunications, sensing, and advanced imaging technologies.</p></p>
